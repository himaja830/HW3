Within the generatePassword function using while loops , prompts were created for user regarding length of password required. Within the while loop min and maximum length ranges were declared using if & else statements.
In similar way using while loops within generatepassword function , prompts were created and conditions were given with if & else statements for lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric & special characters.
Then created Arrays for Numbers,UpperCase charecters,LowerCaseCharacters & special Characters in global scope.
Next, Within generatePassword function using for loop , if statements , using math.floor & math.random, Random indexes for the Arrays were created .
within the generator password function a variable password has been declared.
The generated random indexes were assigned to  password , similarly for all the arrays random indexes were generated within the for loop an d assigned them to password.

At last, within the function password assigned with random values through random indexes were returned.
